      <h1>AC Loss research in high temperature superconductors for fusion technology</h1>
      <p>We have a two (2) fully funded PhD scholarships available for research into experimental and numerical study of energy dissipation (AC loss) in high temperature superconductors for nuclear fusion technology.</p>
        <p>
        The project will target experimental and numerical AC loss studies in 2G coated conductors, Roebel cables/twisted stacks/CORC cables assembled with coated conductors operating in the temperature range of 20 K – 77 K carrying DC current exposed to AC magnetic field. The experimental work will be carried out using the AC loss measurement system under development at Robinson Research Institute. This equipment incorporates an AC copper magnet operating in liquid nitrogen and is able to generate a 0.5 T AC magnetic field at frequencies up to 200 Hz. The sample, located in a cryogenic vacuum chamber, will be separately cooled to temperatures between 20 K and 80 K by two powerful cryocoolers. The simulation work will be carried out using FEM (finite element method). 3D FEM models will be built considering the complicated 3D structure of Roebel cables/twisted stacks/CORCs using COMSOL- Multi-Physics. The 3D simulation model will be validated by experiments and the model will be used to predict AC loss in HTS fusion magnets operating at actual environment.</p>
        <p>
        Throughout this research project you will have the opportunity to work with our supportive team of trusted scientists as well as researchers from other parts of New Zealand and world-renown international collaborators from Kyoto University, and MIT. You will have the opportunity to travel to Kyoto University and attend international conferences to present your most recent findings to the applied superconductivity community.</p>

      <h1>3D fluorescent optical memory for long-term data storage</h1>
      <p>A fully funded PhD scholarship in Physics is available for research into developing ultra-high-density three-dimensional fluorescent optical memory for long-term data storage and preservation at the world leading <a href="https://www.wgtn.ac.nz/robinson"
        target="_blank">Robinson Research Institute</a> at Victoria University of Wellington (VUW), Lower Hutt, New Zealand. This new approach to ultra-high-density memory involves defect- and band-engineering of wide band gap materials to create suitable carrier traps where the luminescence from trapped charges can be used to represent a stored bit. Laser-induced spontaneous and stimulated emissions and a new super-resolution reading and writing method can potentially lead to bit dimensions less than 50 nm resulting in storage capacities exceeding 2 PB. Little is known about how the luminescent properties can be optimised via alternative synthesis routes, dopants, and using various optical stimulations. This research will greatly contribute to the understanding of luminescent materials and the development of proof-of-concept devices.
        </p>
        <p>
        We are looking for a candidate from NZ and abroad to undertake materials preparation using methods that include high-temperature melts and hydrothermal techniques. The materials will be characterised and studied by x-ray diffraction, SEM, TEM, optical absorption, and various luminescence techniques including photoluminescence and stimulated luminescence. The candidate will also participate in the design, construction and implementation of optical experiments involving laser stimulations. Access to additional resources is available through our affiliation with the <a href="https://www.macdiarmid.ac.nz/"
        target="_blank">MacDiarmid Institute for Advanced Materials and Nanotechnology</a>. There is also the opportunity for the candidate to travel abroad to attend international conferences and work with researchers from other parts of New Zealand. We will also consider an MSc project on the same proposed work for a suitable candidate.</p>
      <h2>Eligibility</h2>
      <p>Applicants should have a degree equivalent to the 4-year Physics (Honours) degree in New Zealand, with 1st class Honours, or an MSc or postgraduate Diploma with high grades. We are seeking a highly motivated person with an excellent academic record, a good understanding of physics, and able to work well in a team. Candidates should satisfy the requirements for admission as a PhD candidate at Victoria University and applicants should ensure that they can satisfy the English language <a href="https://www.wgtn.ac.nz/fgr/apply/how/entry-requirements"

      <h1>Chemical programming of mixed-matrix membranes for CO<sub>2</sub> capture</h1>
      <p>Carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) levels are causing a global environmental crisis. Mitigating this crisis will require new effective approaches to reducing CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Mixed-matrix membranes (MMMs) present an attractive option for CO<sub>2</sub> capture. MMMs are made by incorporating a porous filler into a polymer matrix, and they combine the merits of both materials. However, these membranes suffer from several drawbacks, including limited precision in the discrimination of CO<sub>2</sub> from other gases and undesired void spaces due to incompatibilities between the filler and the matrix.</p>

<p>This PhD project will develop new mixed-matrix membranes by incorporating metal-organic framework (MOF) fillers into polymer matrices. The primary focus will be to systematically programme the properties of the MOF fillers to improve the interfacial compatibility and enhance the CO<sub>2</sub> separation performance. In addition to exploring the separation mechanisms at an atomic level, this project will generate new insights to inform the future design of the CO<sub>2</sub> capture membranes.</p>

<p>You will gain familiarity with a wide range of material synthesis techniques and characterisation methods including SEM, TGA/DSC, XRD, physisorption and more. You will also become an expert in experimental and computational membrane analysis.</p>

<p>The PhD will be undertaken at the Victoria University of Wellington under the supervision of <a href="https://people.wgtn.ac.nz/ben.yin" target="_blank">Dr Ben Yin</a> and <a href="https://www.massey.ac.nz/massey/expertise/profile.cfm?stref=454930" target="_blank">Professor Shane Telfer</a>, with expectation to spend time at Massey University in Palmerton North, and collaborate with our key partner investigators from the wider <a href="https://www.macdiarmid.ac.nz/" target="_blank">MacDiarmid Institute</a> and internationally.</p>

      <h2>Eligibility</h2>
      <p>You should hold a 4-year BSc(Hons), MSc/MEng or equivalent degree in Chemical Engineering, Materials Science/Engineering, Chemistry or a related discipline. Previous laboratory experience in porous materials synthesis and membrane research will be advantageous.</p>

        <p>Candidates must satisfy the <a href="https://www.wgtn.ac.nz/study/apply-enrol/apply" target="_blank">requirements for admission</a> as a PhD candidate at Victoria University of Wellington.</p>

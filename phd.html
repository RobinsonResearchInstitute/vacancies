      <h1>Superconducting bearings for high-speed machines</h1>


<p>Would you like to contribute to building a sustainable low-emissions future? High power-density superconducting motors and generators are being actively studied as solutions for powering future large-scale electric aircraft. At Robinson Research Institute we have recently constructed and tested a high-speed superconducting motor/generator at up to 18 000 revolutions per minute (rpm). At such high speeds, heat caused by bearing friction is a major problem and limits the running time of the motor.</p>
<a href="https://robinson.ac.nz/conductors/homopolar10kw.html" target="_blank"><img src="img/2023/scmotor_small.jpg" width="400px"></a>
<p>Non-contact superconducting magnetic levitation bearings offer a solution to this problem. These bearings have been studied in our Institute at a fundamental level, and we have demonstrated working bearings at speeds over 100 000 rpm. Now the goal is to translate this technology into our motor. This project will concern the design, build and evaluation of a suitable mag-lev bearing for our prototype motor.</p>

      <h1>Comprehensive analysis of transformer-HTS interaction for precise flux pump design </h1>
      <p><b>Supervisors:</b> Dr Adam Francis, Prof. Rodney Badcock</p>

      
<p>At Robinson Research Institute we are focused on driving the field of applied superconductivity forward. Superconductive circuits can carry large currents with very little loss especially when electrified by superconducting power supplies. Two types of superconducting power supplies currently exist, Dynamo and transformer rectifier (TR). The later are based on conventional TR power supplies which rectify AC power into DC power via a transformer core and a rectification circuit. The behaviour and mechanisms of power transfer in conventional transformers are well understood, however, this is not true of hybrid transformers consisting of a copper primary and a superconducting secondary. 
  </p>
  <p>
  The proposed Masters by Thesis project will be based around the study of transformers consisting wholly or in part of high temperature superconductor. The findings of this study will then be applied to the design and construction of a new conduction cooled superconducting flux pump. This flux pump will include all of the previous lessons learnt throughout the current literature with the aim of creating a highly predictable and controllable flux pump. Students with a bachelor’s in physics or engineering and a keen interest in electrical engineering and/or applied superconductivity are encouraged to apply. 
</p>

<h2>Funding:</h2>
<p> A tax free stipend of $25,000 NZD (plus fees) for one year is available to the successful applicant. <p>

      <h1>3D fluorescent optical memory for long-term data storage</h1>
      <p>Two fully funded Masters scholarships in Physics are available for research into developing ultra-high-density three-dimensional fluorescent optical memory for long-term data storage and preservation at the world leading <a href="https://www.wgtn.ac.nz/robinson"
        target="_blank">Robinson Research Institute</a> at Victoria University of Wellington (VUW), Lower Hutt, New Zealand. This new approach to ultra-high-density memory involves defect- and band-engineering of wide band gap materials to create suitable carrier traps where the luminescence from trapped charges can be used to represent a stored bit. Laser-induced spontaneous and stimulated emissions and a new super-resolution reading and writing method can potentially lead to bit dimensions less than 50 nm resulting in storage capacities exceeding 2 PB. Little is known about how the luminescent properties can be optimised via alternative synthesis routes, dopants, and using various optical stimulations. This research will greatly contribute to the understanding of luminescent materials and the development of proof-of-concept devices.
        </p>
        <p>
        We are looking for a candidate from NZ and abroad to undertake materials preparation using methods that include high-temperature melts and hydrothermal techniques. The materials will be characterised and studied by x-ray diffraction, SEM, TEM, optical absorption, and various luminescence techniques including photoluminescence and stimulated luminescence. The candidate will also participate in the design, construction and implementation of optical experiments involving laser stimulations. Access to additional resources is available through our affiliation with the <a href="https://www.macdiarmid.ac.nz/"
        target="_blank">MacDiarmid Institute for Advanced Materials and Nanotechnology</a>. There is also the opportunity for the candidate to travel abroad to attend international conferences and work with researchers from other parts of New Zealand. We will also consider an MSc project on the same proposed work for a suitable candidate.</p>
      <h2>Eligibility</h2>
      <p>Applicants should have a BSc in physics (or materials physics) with high <a href="https://www.wgtn.ac.nz/explore/postgraduate-programmes/master-of-science-by-thesis/requirements">grades</a>. We are seeking highly motivated individuals with excellent academic records, a good understanding of physics, and the ability to work well in a team.

      <h1>Chemical programming of mixed-matrix membranes for CO<sub>2</sub> capture</h1>
      <p>Carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) levels are causing a global environmental crisis. Mitigating this crisis will require new effective approaches to reducing CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Mixed-matrix membranes (MMMs) present an attractive option for CO<sub>2</sub> capture. MMMs are made by incorporating a porous filler into a polymer matrix, and they combine the merits of both materials. However, these membranes suffer from several drawbacks, including limited precision in the discrimination of CO<sub>2</sub> from other gases and undesired void spaces due to incompatibilities between the filler and the matrix.</p>

<p>This PhD project will develop new mixed-matrix membranes by incorporating metal-organic framework (MOF) fillers into polymer matrices. The primary focus will be to systematically programme the properties of the MOF fillers to improve the interfacial compatibility and enhance the CO<sub>2</sub> separation performance. In addition to exploring the separation mechanisms at an atomic level, this project will generate new insights to inform the future design of the CO<sub>2</sub> capture membranes.</p>

<p>You will gain familiarity with a wide range of material synthesis techniques and characterisation methods including SEM, TGA/DSC, XRD, physisorption and more. You will also become an expert in experimental and computational membrane analysis.</p>

<p>The PhD will be undertaken at the Victoria University of Wellington under the supervision of <a href="https://people.wgtn.ac.nz/ben.yin" target="_blank">Dr Ben Yin</a> and <a href="https://www.massey.ac.nz/massey/expertise/profile.cfm?stref=454930" target="_blank">Professor Shane Telfer</a>, with expectation to spend time at Massey University in Palmerton North, and collaborate with our key partner investigators from the wider <a href="https://www.macdiarmid.ac.nz/" target="_blank">MacDiarmid Institute</a> and internationally.</p>

      <h2>Eligibility</h2>
      <p>You should hold a 4-year BSc(Hons), MSc/MEng or equivalent degree in Chemical Engineering, Materials Science/Engineering, Chemistry or a related discipline. Previous laboratory experience in porous materials synthesis and membrane research will be advantageous.</p>

        <p>Candidates must satisfy the <a href="https://www.wgtn.ac.nz/study/apply-enrol/apply" target="_blank">requirements for admission</a> as a PhD candidate at Victoria University of Wellington.</p>

     
      <h2>Total value and tenure of scholarship</h2>
      <p>The successful applicant will receive a 3-year scholarship comprising all university fees and an untaxed stipend of up to NZ$35k per annum.
        This project will be funded through the MacDiarmid Institute New Zealand’s Centre of Research Excellence for Advanced Materials and Nanotechnology. </p>

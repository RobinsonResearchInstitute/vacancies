      <h1>Powering the next generation of superconducting devices</h1>
      <h2>Background</h2>

<p>Superconductivity has the potential to revolutionise the modern world. From space-based magnetoplasmadynamic thrusters, fusion energy reactors and highly efficient motors, superconductors can drive real change. Currently, electromagnets are the most developed of all superconductor applications. In electromagnets, superconductivity enables the generation of large magnetic fields beyond the capabilities of standard conductors facilitating unprecedented research (such as the LHC at CERN) and life-changing medical scanning (such as MRI).</p>

<p>While existing systems are based around low temperature superconductors, the next generation of superconductor applications will be determined by high-temperature superconductors (HTS). HTS can generate higher magnetic fields and operate at elevated temperatures enabling a new range of applications.</p>

<h2>About Paihau—Robinson</h2>

<p>The Paihau—Robinson Research Institute is a world leading organisation exploring HTSs ranging from superconductor fabrication to real-world implementation. One area of essential importance is the powering of these superconducting electromagnets. To fully utilise HTS electromagnets massive currents will be necessary and new techniques are required which are safe, energy efficient, and unobtrusive.</p>

<p>We are at the forefront of developing a unique power supply (superconducting flux pumps) which innately utilise superconducting properties to generate high currents (>kA) with little power loss. Flux pumps can play an essential role in the next generation of superconducting devices.</p>

<h2>Project details</h2>

<p>This PhD project will explore and optimise a range of flux pump configurations, mechanisms, and designs. It will be a multi-disciplinary challenge driven by Robinson Research Institute's growing understanding of the underlying physics, our vast experience of real-world systems, and the wide range of experimental and computational tools we have developed.</p>

<p>The successful candidate will create new flux pump designs utilising COMSOL-based finite-element analysis and our existing Simulink model. Once optimised these concepts will be produced and tested within the lab. Experimental validation will play a fundamental role in the PhD ensuring that the candidate gains experience working hands-on. This two-pronged approach will allow a detailed exploration of the interplay between the superconducting mechanisms and the real-world output. Ultimately, the goal is to create an 'industry-ready' bespoke flux pump primed for commercialisation.</p>

<h2>Eligibility</h2>

<p>Candidates will have an Honours or Masters degree in engineering, applied physics, or related field. Candidates must also satisfy admission requirements for PhD study at Victoria University of Wellington, including proof of english language proficiency if applicable.</p>

<h2>Funding Notes</h2>
<p>The scholarship will fund full tuition fees, students levies, insurance, and a stipend of $35,000 NZD per annum for three (3) years. </p>

      <h1>Comprehensive analysis of transformer-HTS interaction for precise flux pump design </h1>
      <p><b>Supervisors:</b> Dr Adam Francis, Prof. Rodney Badcock</p>

      <h2>Main points of research: </h2>
<ol>
<li>Measure and model cryogenic B-H and hysteresis performance of inductor materials including nano materials, alloys and exotic materials. </li>

<li>Understand transformer physics in combination with a High Temperature Superconducting (HTS) secondary through experiment and relate to a Jiles-Atherton model. </li>

<li>Design and build a conduction cooled transformer rectifier flux pump that performs as predicted. </li>
</ol>
<h2>Funding:</h2>
<p> A tax free stipend of $25,000 NZD (plus fees) for one year is available to the successful applicant. <p>

<h2>Potential employment opportunities:</h2> 
<p>Practical experience of cryogenic superconducting systems, flux pumping, and HTS magnets is in extreme demand locally (Wellington; HTS-110 and Openstar) and internationally with our partners (MIT, Commonwealth Fusion Systems, UKAEA STEP, Tokamak Energy). The industry wants more masters level graduates in this area coming through Robinson for employment. </p>

<h2>Outline of project:</h2> 
<p>Investigate how the turns ratio of small transformers with a copper primary winding and HTS secondary winding are affected by different variables. This is an open question as we have experienced turns ratios that seem to not follow conventional explanations. This will be probed via an AC input with different primary currents and frequencies. Low frequencies will be used in an attempt to minimise AC loss considerations. The temperature of HTS components is a critical factor in how they perform. Different operating temperatures will be accessed via a cold head in a vacuum chamber. A testing rig will need to be created to deepen our understanding of transformer-HTS behaviour. The findings from the transformer studies will then be applied to the design and construction of a new conduction cooled flux pump. This flux pump when properly characterised will then be used to assess the accuracy of our knowledge of HTS flux pumps. </p>

<h2>Variables to be tested in transformer study:</h2> 
<p>Frequency, temperature, primary copper turns (N1), secondary HTS turns (N2), core cross sectional area, secondary resistance. </p>

<h2>Transformer study outline:</h2> 
<p>A range of parameters must be measured in real-time during the study to accurately determine the transformer performance. These include the voltages generated across the primary and secondary windings, the magnetisation state of the transformer core, and the impedance of the load circuit.

A primary current range will be found such that the maximum current of the primary or secondary does not exceed the ratings of either primary or secondary windings and that the maximum power of the power supplies is not reached. 

The range of frequencies tested should not exceed ~ 25Hz.  

The primary measurement techniques will likely be open loop hall sensors for the primary and secondary currents and voltage taps for any voltage sources in both the primary and secondary. 

When testing the effect of secondary resistance, copper shunts or a Jc(B) switch (bifilar) can be used. Any joints will need to be low resistance and will therefore require permanent clamping with high clamping pressures. This will most likely need to be included in the testing apparatus design.  

The core flux during operation will be measured via a hall probe placed in an air gap in the transformer core. With room for new measurement methodologies to be explored. 

The characterisation of the transformer core material will be carried out by the student via a physical properties measurement system (PPMS) at Robinson.  
</p>
<h2>Conduction-cooled flux pump:</h2>
<p> The knowledge gained from the transformer study will be combined with our current understanding of HTS flux pumps to create a new conduction-cooled HTS flux pump. The optimisation during design will rely heavily on previous research carried out at Robinson. This design will be a modification to a previous conduction-cooled design and will utilise some existing components. The main aim of the creation of this new flux pump is to demonstrate a complete understanding of HTS flux pumps for real world application. </p>

      <h1>AC Loss research in high temperature superconductors for fusion technology</h1>
      <p>We have a two (2) fully funded PhD scholarships available for research into experimental and numerical study of energy dissipation (AC loss) in high temperature superconductors for nuclear fusion technology.</p>
        <p>
        The project will target experimental and numerical AC loss studies in 2G coated conductors, Roebel cables/twisted stacks/CORC cables assembled with coated conductors operating in the temperature range of 20 K – 77 K carrying DC current exposed to AC magnetic field. The experimental work will be carried out using the AC loss measurement system under development at Robinson Research Institute. This equipment incorporates an AC copper magnet operating in liquid nitrogen and is able to generate a 0.5 T AC magnetic field at frequencies up to 200 Hz. The sample, located in a cryogenic vacuum chamber, will be separately cooled to temperatures between 20 K and 80 K by two powerful cryocoolers. The simulation work will be carried out using FEM (finite element method). 3D FEM models will be built considering the complicated 3D structure of Roebel cables/twisted stacks/CORCs using COMSOL- Multi-Physics. The 3D simulation model will be validated by experiments and the model will be used to predict AC loss in HTS fusion magnets operating at actual environment.</p>

      <h1>3D fluorescent optical memory for long-term data storage</h1>
      <p>Two fully funded Masters scholarships in Physics are available for research into developing ultra-high-density three-dimensional fluorescent optical memory for long-term data storage and preservation at the world leading <a href="https://www.wgtn.ac.nz/robinson"
        target="_blank">Robinson Research Institute</a> at Victoria University of Wellington (VUW), Lower Hutt, New Zealand. This new approach to ultra-high-density memory involves defect- and band-engineering of wide band gap materials to create suitable carrier traps where the luminescence from trapped charges can be used to represent a stored bit. Laser-induced spontaneous and stimulated emissions and a new super-resolution reading and writing method can potentially lead to bit dimensions less than 50 nm resulting in storage capacities exceeding 2 PB. Little is known about how the luminescent properties can be optimised via alternative synthesis routes, dopants, and using various optical stimulations. This research will greatly contribute to the understanding of luminescent materials and the development of proof-of-concept devices.
        </p>
        <p>
        We are looking for a candidate from NZ and abroad to undertake materials preparation using methods that include high-temperature melts and hydrothermal techniques. The materials will be characterised and studied by x-ray diffraction, SEM, TEM, optical absorption, and various luminescence techniques including photoluminescence and stimulated luminescence. The candidate will also participate in the design, construction and implementation of optical experiments involving laser stimulations. Access to additional resources is available through our affiliation with the <a href="https://www.macdiarmid.ac.nz/"
        target="_blank">MacDiarmid Institute for Advanced Materials and Nanotechnology</a>.

      <h1>Chemical programming of mixed-matrix membranes for CO<sub>2</sub> capture</h1>
      <p>Carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) levels are causing a global environmental crisis. Mitigating this crisis will require new effective approaches to reducing CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Mixed-matrix membranes (MMMs) present an attractive option for CO<sub>2</sub> capture. MMMs are made by incorporating a porous filler into a polymer matrix, and they combine the merits of both materials. However, these membranes suffer from several drawbacks, including limited precision in the discrimination of CO<sub>2</sub> from other gases and undesired void spaces due to incompatibilities between the filler and the matrix.</p>

<p>This PhD project will develop new mixed-matrix membranes by incorporating metal-organic framework (MOF) fillers into polymer matrices. The primary focus will be to systematically programme the properties of the MOF fillers to improve the interfacial compatibility and enhance the CO<sub>2</sub> separation performance. In addition to exploring the separation mechanisms at an atomic level, this project will generate new insights to inform the future design of the CO<sub>2</sub> capture membranes.</p>

<p>You will gain familiarity with a wide range of material synthesis techniques and characterisation methods including SEM, TGA/DSC, XRD, physisorption and more. You will also become an expert in experimental and computational membrane analysis.</p>

<p>The PhD will be undertaken at the Victoria University of Wellington under the supervision of <a href="https://people.wgtn.ac.nz/ben.yin" target="_blank">Dr Ben Yin</a> and <a href="https://www.massey.ac.nz/massey/expertise/profile.cfm?stref=454930" target="_blank">Professor Shane Telfer</a>, with expectation to spend time at Massey University in Palmerton North, and collaborate with our key partner investigators from the wider <a href="https://www.macdiarmid.ac.nz/" target="_blank">MacDiarmid Institute</a> and internationally.</p>

      <h2>Eligibility</h2>
      <p>You should hold a 4-year BSc(Hons), MSc/MEng or equivalent degree in Chemical Engineering, Materials Science/Engineering, Chemistry or a related discipline. Previous laboratory experience in porous materials synthesis and membrane research will be advantageous.</p>

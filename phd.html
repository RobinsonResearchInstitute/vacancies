      <h1>Energy dissipation in SMES magnet for space applications</h1>

      <p>Due to the harsh environment, long operational timescales, complexity, and required compactness, space
        platforms require specialised energy storage mechanisms. In many instances the step load profile and large
        number of discharges constrains application of ion batteries. In such situations auxiliary energy treatment
        systems are often necessary to correct electric characteristics of the electric systems. SMES, with its
        high-energy and power densities, could be a potential solution if a correct thermal management system can be
        provided.</p>

      <p>The PhD project will target studies over transient behaviour of superconducting coils for SMES applications.
        Activities will be centred around the design analysis and optimisation of the coil, thermal buss and cryogenic
        system. Special attention will be given to the duty cycle and power loss in HTS coils wound with 2G coated
        conductors during ramping up and down of the coils within the operating temperature range, using finite element
        method (FEM). This model will include coupling between temperature and electromagnetic properties of HTS coils
        due to power loss. The model will be validated by experiments carried out within the liquid nitrogen temperature
        range. Student will have full access to Robinson’s state-of-the art AC loss measurement system, which will need
        to be tailored for HTS coils carrying non-sinusoidal current.</p>

      <p>This PhD project is part of our space programme funded in Paihau—Robinson Research Institute. Our institute has
        set itself to become a leading institute in application of superconducting materials in space technology. We
        have active research programs in space propulsion, thermal optimisation of small propulsion and design of space
        qualified magnet technologies for space applications.</p>

      <h1>Chemical programming of mixed-matrix membranes for CO<sub>2</sub> capture</h1>
      <p>Carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) levels are causing a global environmental crisis. Mitigating this crisis will require new effective approaches to reducing CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Mixed-matrix membranes (MMMs) present an attractive option for CO<sub>2</sub> capture. MMMs are made by incorporating a porous filler into a polymer matrix, and they combine the merits of both materials. However, these membranes suffer from several drawbacks, including limited precision in the discrimination of CO<sub>2</sub> from other gases and undesired void spaces due to incompatibilities between the filler and the matrix.</p>

<p>This PhD project will develop new mixed-matrix membranes by incorporating metal-organic framework (MOF) fillers into polymer matrices. The primary focus will be to systematically programme the properties of the MOF fillers to improve the interfacial compatibility and enhance the CO<sub>2</sub> separation performance. In addition to exploring the separation mechanisms at an atomic level, this project will generate new insights to inform the future design of the CO<sub>2</sub> capture membranes.</p>

<p>You will gain familiarity with a wide range of material synthesis techniques and characterisation methods including SEM, TGA/DSC, XRD, physisorption and more. You will also become an expert in experimental and computational membrane analysis.</p>

<p>The PhD will be undertaken at the Victoria University of Wellington under the supervision of <a href="https://people.wgtn.ac.nz/ben.yin" target="_blank">Dr Ben Yin</a> and <a href="https://www.massey.ac.nz/massey/expertise/profile.cfm?stref=454930" target="_blank">Professor Shane Telfer</a>, with expectation to spend time at Massey University in Palmerton North, and collaborate with our key partner investigators from the wider <a href="https://www.macdiarmid.ac.nz/" target="_blank">MacDiarmid Institute</a> and internationally.</p>

      <h2>Eligibility</h2>
      <p>You should hold a 4-year BSc(Hons), MSc/MEng or equivalent degree in Chemical Engineering, Materials Science/Engineering, Chemistry or a related discipline. Previous laboratory experience in porous materials synthesis and membrane research will be advantageous.</p>

    <h1>Hardware testing of electric aircraft powertrains for domestic New Zealand aviation</h1>
    <p>Paihau-Robinson Research Institute is developing electric motors and powertrain components for large scale electric aircraft. As part of this work it is important to understand how these components behave under real world flight conditions. Your responsibility through this Master’s project is to estimate the requirements of a medium-large scale electric passenger aircraft for use on short haul New Zealand routes.</p>

    <p>Prior work at Robinson Research Institute has delivered a Hardware-in-Loop (HiLs) flight simulation system. This system enables aircraft behaviour calculated through flight simulation software to synchronously operate scaled aircraft powertrain hardware. The next step towards accurate estimation of electric aircraft performance is modifying this system to represent full-scale powertrain hardware, and validate these modifications against real world flight data. The completed system will then be used to investigate the technical requirements for successful commercial electric aircraft applications.</p>
    
    <p>The project is part of a Government funded research program focused on <a href="https://www.electrictransport.co.nz/" target="_blank">electrifying large scale transport</a> in New Zealand that involves researchers and students from other universities and polytechnics.</p>


    <h2>Eligibility</h2>
    <p>The ideal candidate has an interest in electric vehicles and aviation, can program in Python or similar languages, is willing to work with mechanical and electronic systems, and is a self-directed learner capable of working independently.</p>

     
    <h2>Total value and tenure of scholarship</h2>
    <p>The scholarship will pay an untaxed stipend for one (1) year, full tuition fees, and levies.</p>

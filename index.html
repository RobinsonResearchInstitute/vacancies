    <h1>Research Assistant</h1>
    <h2>The Role</h2>
    <p>
      A Research Assistant position (fixed-term, 1 year) is available at Paihau-Robinson Research Institute, based at the Gracefield Innovation Quarter in Lower Hutt. </p>
      <p>
      The selected candidate will conduct synthetic preparation of new materials samples in high-temperature atmosphere-controlled furnaces.
      </p>
      <h2>About the project - Hydrogen storage materials</h2>
    <p>Hydrogen will play a key role in the future zero-carbon economy, as a fuel for both transport and industry. However, hydrogen is a low-density gas, thus challenging to store for use 'on-demand'. One approach is to use reversible hydrogen-storage materials such as the intermetallic alloy, Ti-Fe.</p>
    <p>
      In this project, we will explore alternative new synthetic routes to produce Ti-Fe.  The primary focus will be to pursue high-temperature metallurgical approaches and develop a proof-of-concept laboratory process suitable for scaling to industrial volumes. You will assist in the preparation of materials.</p>
    <p>  
      The role is based at the Paihau—Robinson Research Institute and will involve close collaboration with Senior researchers from the Advanced Materials Group at Callaghan Innovation.</p>
      
    

    <h2>We are looking for</h2>
    <p>A graduate in chemistry or chemical engineering (1st class Honors), MSc/ME, or related physical science discipline.
      </p>
      <p>
      Successful candidate must display an aptitude for hands-on laboratory work, rigorous attention to detail and ability to follow self-directed plans.</p>

    <h1>Lead Research and Development Engineer</h1>
    <p>The Lead Research and Development (R&D) Engineer will contribute to the research design and development of an exciting new electrical technology capable of heating industrial gas streams to > 1000C. This has the potential to revolutionise the future of steel and cement-making industries, which account for 15% of all global CO2 Emissions. As an experienced R&D engineer you will be working alongside world-leading researchers to decarbonise these industries for New Zealand and the world.</p>

    <p>Lead R&D Engineer is a split role between Wellington UniVentures and the Robinson Research Institute, utilising Industry expertise and knowledge to grow our project within the Robinson Research Institute Green Steel team. </p>

      <p>Key responsibilities span across the project, with key activities including: </p>
     <ul> 
    <li>Design, procurement, and assembly of prototype systems incorporating refractory components, electrical elements and gas delivery control. </li>
      
  <li>Experimental testing and characterisation of prototype systems to validate existing models and optimise performance. </li>
      
<li> Participation in iterative design improvements in conjunction with our wider team. </li>
</ul>
    

    <h2>About You</h2>
    <p>Our ideal candidate will either hold a degree in mechanical or electrical engineering or have at least 5 years relevant industrial experience. Preferably, they will have experience and knowledge in some of the following areas:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Construction of high temperature furnaces incorporating refractory materials and controlled atmospheres, or, design and implementation of automated feedback control for gas flow systems. </li>
      
    <li>Comfortable working in an experimental R&D environment, and able to swiftly pivot thinking in response to new ideas and data. </li>
      
    <li>Ability to understand complex technologies and interpret their application in a commercial environment.</li>
      
      <li>Demonstrated ability to maintain effective relationships with stakeholders, both managerially and externally and work as part of a team.</li>
